# asunaroblog

This is my personal blog ([asunaroblog](https://asunaroblog.net/)) repository. It's built with astro(react) and Newt (Jamstack).

## Framework
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
  1. **Performance**: Astro is designed to deliver fast, optimized websites by default. It achieves this by shipping less JavaScript to the client, which results in faster load times and a better user experience.
  2. **Static Site Generation**: Astro supports static site generation (SSG), which is perfect for a blog.
  3. **React Component Integration**: Astro's seamless integration with React allows us to reuse components from previous projects, making it easier to migrate or upgrade our blog without having to rewrite existing code.

## UI design

## Hosting service
